 # Description:
            
 The Workout Tracker application allows the user to track their workouts. Users can choose between resistance and cardio routines and then add their exercise, along with the weight, set, rep count, and the time taken to complete the workout exercise.  The tracker keeps a record of all of the exercises in the workout and logs the workout details when the complete button is clicked. The user can then view their workout stats by going to the Workout Dashboard.
